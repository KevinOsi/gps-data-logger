# Track Specification: Project Documentation & Wiring Diagram

## Overview
This track focuses on the "presentation" and "clarity" of the project. We will produce a developer-friendly README, a technical `docs/` folder, and a custom SVG wiring diagram to ensure anyone can replicate the hardware setup easily.

## Objectives
1.  **Repository Landing Page:** Create a `README.md` that explains the project's value proposition, features, and quick-start guide.
2.  **Technical Deep-Dive:** Create `docs/hardware.md` (wiring details, component specs) and `docs/software.md` (architecture, task distribution).
3.  **Vector Wiring Diagram:** Produce a clean SVG file illustrating the ESP-WROOM-32 (30-pin) connected to all peripherals based on the verified `hw_config.h`.

## Success Criteria
*   `README.md` is present and informative.
*   `docs/` folder contains hardware and software technical sheets.
*   An SVG wiring diagram is generated and referenced in the documentation.
*   All documentation is pushed to the GitHub repository.
